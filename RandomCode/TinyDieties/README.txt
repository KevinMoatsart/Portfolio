This project was a little mess around with AI for me. This code (once again created using the Unity 3D game engine) made workers:

-Wander aimlessly
-If they come upon a resource, they collect it
-If their "bag" is full, they return to HQ and deposit the resources into storage there.
-Headquarters contains all kinds of resources

What was funny about this one is, they all technically brought back the value "resource." What changed was depending on their job,
determined what the resource got turned into when depositing the resource into HQ. Nice little work around I created.
