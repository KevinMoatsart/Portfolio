Abandoned is a game that I created with a small team in 2015. I was the programmer and also the developer of the group. I assigned tasks, due-dates, and incorporated all their
assets into the actual build. I led an artist and someone else was in charge of music and sound. We brainstormed and developed ideas with pen and paper and then
I assigned the actual needs and dates for them to be completed.  All the code is written by me, while using the Unity3D game engine's API. Whenever I create games I want them to be for multiple players because
I grew up with siblings. Making this game was extremely fun and taught me a lot about C#. The main focus of making this game was to practice leading a team to fully
develop a game from beginning to end.
