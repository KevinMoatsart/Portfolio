I created this game early 2016 completely on my own with the Unity 3D game engine. 
The only script in here not written by me is AutoFade, which turns the screen between game scenes
black. I also did not create the music or sound FX! The main focus of this game is to create
a peaceful environment where to people can solve very simple puzzles together. I also
wanted to work on making the overall game and code feel sleek.
